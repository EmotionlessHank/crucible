name: worktree-dev
description: Enforced worktree-isolated development. Triggers when the user says "/worktree-dev", "worktree dev", "isolated dev", "open a worktree for this", or "wt dev". Automatically executes: pull a new branch from main → create worktree → sync env → inject isolation context → lock working directory throughout. Solves two high-frequency problems: "agent drifts out of the worktree and contaminates the main workspace" and "forgot to branch off main before starting".
version: 2.0.0

# /worktree-dev — Enforced Worktree-Isolated Development

> Works together with feat/autopilot: worktree-dev handles **isolated environment setup + cwd locking**; feat plans inside it, autopilot develops inside it.

**Core rule: once inside a worktree, all file reads/writes, git operations, and build commands must execute within the worktree directory. Jumping back to the main workspace is strictly prohibited.**

---

## Phase 0: Parameter Collection

### 0.1 Collect Required Information

| Parameter | Source | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Feature name | User description | "new strategy implementation" |
| Branch name | Auto-inferred (user can override) | `feat/new-strategy` |
| Plan document | Match in `docs/{type}/` | `{ID}` subfolder |

**Branch naming conventions** (inherited from project rules): `feat/` (new feature) · `fix/` (bug fix) · `chore/` (config/dependencies) · `refactor/` (refactoring).

### 0.2 Pre-flight Check

```bash
git fetch origin main
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline   # warn user to pull first if behind
```

---

## Phase 1: Worktree Creation

### 1.1 Create Worktree (Enforced Path)

```bash
# Only legal path: .worktrees/<name>
git worktree add .worktrees/<name> -b <branch-name> main

# All other paths prohibited (/tmp, outside the repo, arbitrary directories)
```

> Note: `.worktrees` is gitignored in this project — worktree directories will not appear in `git status` output.

### 1.2 Sync Environment / Runtime Files (symlink — mandatory)

The following gitignored files must be symlinked into every worktree. **Use symlinks, not `cp`** — copies are static snapshots; if the main workspace later updates a secrets file, the worktree won't see it, sending troubleshooting in the wrong direction.

| File | Consequence if missing |
|------|------------------------|
| `.env` | Bot starts with no/empty credentials — exchange connections fail silently or with auth errors |
| `config/config.live.json` | Live trading config absent — bot falls back to defaults or errors on startup |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Local Claude Code permissions absent — permission prompts inside the worktree |

```bash
# Run from the main workspace root (/Users/hang/AI/trading)
# The worktree sits two levels deep (.worktrees/<name>/), so relative depth is ../../

ln -sf ../../.env .worktrees/<name>/.env
ln -sf ../../../config/config.live.json .worktrees/<name>/config/config.live.json
ln -sf ../../../.claude/settings.local.json .worktrees/<name>/.claude/settings.local.json
```

> ⚠️ **Symlink depth**: count `../` from the link's *own* directory back to the main workspace root. A link that lands deeper in the tree needs one `../` per level — getting this wrong produces a **dangling symlink** (points nowhere). `ls -l` each link to confirm it resolves to a real file.
>
> ⚠️ **Tracked-file guard (critical, branch-dependent)**: some files are gitignored on most branches but **git-tracked on others**. When the worktree is checked out from such a branch, the file is **already present**; running `ln -sf` over it replaces the real file with a symlink → `git status` shows a typechange (`T`). **Guard before symlinking**: if the file is tracked, skip the symlink and edit the real file directly; only symlink when it is gitignored / missing.
> ```bash
> if git -C .worktrees/<name> ls-files --error-unmatch .env >/dev/null 2>&1; then
>   echo ".env is tracked and came with the checkout — skip symlink, edit the real file"
> else
>   ln -sf ../../.env .worktrees/<name>/.env  # only when gitignored/missing
> fi
> ```

> **Consequence of missing symlinks**: missing env files often **silently fall back** to a default/wrong environment (no error thrown) — this is the most insidious pitfall. Verify each symlink points to a valid file before proceeding.

### 1.3 Install Dependencies

```bash
# Run inside the worktree directory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1.4 Output Creation Confirmation

```
Worktree created
Path: .worktrees/<name>
Branch: <branch-name> (based on main)
Plan: <plan document path | none>
Isolation mode: active
From this point on, all operations are locked to the worktree directory.
```

---

## Phase 2: Isolated Development (Core Constraints)

### 2.0 Pre-batch Read Checklist (Mandatory — First Step Before Any Edits)

**After entering the worktree and before any Edit/Write operations**, read all files involved in this batch concurrently in a single pass.

**Why you cannot interleave Edit and Read**:
- Edit/Write/MultiEdit have a hard constraint — the same path must be Read before it can be Edited
- **Path exact match**: the main workspace path and the worktree path are two different files from the tool's perspective (`strategy/my_strat.py` vs `.worktrees/X/strategy/my_strat.py`) — a Read of the main workspace path does not allow an Edit of the worktree path
- Interleaving Edit-fail and Read → each file incurs one "Edit fails → Read → retry" round trip; N files = N round trips, constantly interrupting the work rhythm

**Correct approach**: ① List all files planned for this batch → ② **Concurrently Read the entire list in one message** → ③ Edit continuously.

| Task type | Required reads |
|-----------|----------------|
| Modify 1 strategy | That file + its tests + referenced indicator/utility files |
| Modify config handling | Config file + tests + callers (up to 3–5) |
| Modify data pipeline | Pipeline file + tests + adjacent loaders/transforms |
| Modify infrastructure | File to change + 1 reference file of the same kind (style alignment) |

### 2.0.1 Working Directory Lock (Highest Priority Rule)

After entering the worktree, the following are all prohibited without exception:

| Prohibited | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| `cd /Users/hang/AI/trading` back to main workspace | — |
| Read/Edit/Write paths in the main workspace | — |
| Run `git commit/push/merge` in the main workspace | — |
| Run `build/test/dev` in the main workspace | — |

**Only legal exception (read-only)**: reading documents under `docs/` (plans/todos/lessons) and reading `CLAUDE.md` (project rules).

### 2.1 Path Guard (Self-check before every tool call)

```
Legal read/write prefix: /Users/hang/AI/trading/.worktrees/<name>/
Read-only prefix: /Users/hang/AI/trading/docs/ · /Users/hang/AI/trading/CLAUDE.md
All other main workspace paths → BLOCK
```

### 2.2 Batch Development

Follow the batch rules from `/feat` → `/autopilot`: <= 5 files per batch; after each batch completes, verify inside the worktree:

```bash
cd .worktrees/<name> && ruff check . && pytest -q
```

### 2.3 Batch Announcement (with worktree context)

```
Batch N/M complete
Worktree: .worktrees/<name> | <branch-name>
Modified files: <worktree-relative paths>...
Verification: lint OK | tests OK
Isolation status: clean (main workspace untouched)
```

---

## Phase 3: Commit and Cleanup

### 3.1 Commit Inside the Worktree

```bash
cd .worktrees/<name>
git add <specific files> && git commit -m "<commit message>"
```

Commit message follows project conventions: English, Conventional Commits style, plus the Co-Authored-By + Claude-Session trailers per session policy.

### 3.2 Final Verification

```bash
cd .worktrees/<name> && ruff check . && ruff format --check . && pytest -q && python -m compileall -q .
```

### 3.3 Completion Announcement + Cleanup Guide

```
Worktree development complete
Path: .worktrees/<name> | Branch: <branch-name> | Commits: <commit count>
Isolation status: main workspace untouched throughout

Next steps (AI handles by default / or user manually, per project convention):
  1. Sync docs back to main workspace (if gitignored and won't flow back via merge)
  2. In main workspace, squash merge: git merge --squash <branch-name> → commit
  3. Cleanup: git worktree remove .worktrees/<name> + git branch -d <branch-name>
```

> **Merging back to main + pushing to remote is the user's responsibility** — AI stops at the local main branch squash commit by default and does not auto-push (unless the project explicitly authorizes AI to finalize the local merge; pushing is always the user's decision).

## Exception Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Worktree path already exists | Prompt user: reuse or delete and recreate |
| `.env` symlink missing or dangling | Re-run symlink step; bot will fail auth without it |
| `config/config.live.json` symlink missing or dangling | Re-run symlink step; live config will be absent |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` symlink missing | Re-run symlink step; local permissions won't apply |
| Dependency install fails | Check Python version, virtualenv activation, output error log |
| Agent accidentally returns to main workspace | Stop immediately, declare the violation, switch back to worktree and continue |
| Lint/type check has pre-existing errors | Mark as "legacy errors", continue if unrelated to this change |
| User asks to "also quickly fix XX in the main workspace" | Decline — suggest opening a separate session to handle it in the main workspace |

---

## Agent Delegation Scenario

When the main agent delegates worktree development to a subagent via the `Agent tool`, the prompt must include:

```
Isolation constraint (highest priority):
- Working directory locked to: /Users/hang/AI/trading/.worktrees/<name>/
- All Read/Edit/Write/Bash must operate within this directory
- Reading or writing files under /Users/hang/AI/trading/ outside of docs/ is prohibited
- Running any git/build commands in the main workspace is prohibited
```
